Relx
=======

A release assembler for Erlang.

Synopsis
--------

relx [*options*] [*release-specification-file*]

Description
-----------

Relx assembles releases for an Erlang/OTP release. Given a release
specification and a list of directories in which to search for OTP
applications it will generate a release output. That output depends
heavily on what plugins available and what options are defined, but
usually it is simply a well configured release directory.

The *release-specification-file* is optional but otherwise contains
additional specification information for releases.

Building
--------

To build relx and generate a standalone escript executable:

    $ ./rebar3 update
    $ ./rebar3 as escript escriptize

This creates the executable `_build/escript/bin/relx`.

Building on Windows
-------------------

To build relx on Windows you'll need to have rebar3 installed and the path to
the rebar3 binary added to the `PATH` environment variable. To start the build
use the `bootstrap` batch file:

    c:\> bootstrap

This creates the executable `relx` and the `relx.cmd` shortcut script. Copy
both of these files to a directory and make the directory available to the
`PATH` environment variable.

Config File
-----------

By default `relx` looks for `relx.config` in the current working directory:

```erlang
{release, {relname, "vsn"},
 [app1,
  app2]}.

{extended_start_script, true}.
```
