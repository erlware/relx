## Time warp mode
##
##  There are three time warp modes available in ERTS which will be covered in brief below and in recommended 
##  order. See https://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html for a more detailed explanation. 
##
## multi_time_warp :
##
##   Multi-time warp mode in combination with time correction is the preferred configuration. Only Erlang runtime 
##   systems executing on ancient platforms benefit from another configuration. In this mode the time offset can change 
##   at any time without any limitations to provide good system time, and the Erlang monotonic clock frequency can be 
##   adjusted by the VM to be as accurate as possible. This is what you want to specify on any modern platform, and 
##   tends to have provide better performance, scalaibility, accuracy, and behaviour.
##
## single_time_warp : 
## 
##    This is a special hybrid mode to be used on embedded hardware when you know Erlang boots before the OS clock is 
##    synchronized (for example, you boot your software before NTP synchronization can take place). When the VM boots,
##    the Erlang monotonic## clock is kept as stable as possible, but no system time adjustments are made. Once time 
##    synchronization is done at the OS level, the user calls erlang:system_flag(time_offset, finalize), the Erlang 
##    system time warps once to match the OS system time, and then the clocks become equivalent to those under 
##
## no_time_warp :
##
##   This mode is the default in ERTS, but is not the best mode nor the recommended mode. It is only the default 
##   for backwards compatibility with ERTS versions prior 7.0. In this mode the time offset is chosen at VM start time, 
##   and then is never modified. Instead, the monotonic clock is sped up or slowed down using a purposefully faulty
##   frequency to slowly correct time drift. That purposeful faulty frequency can result in errors as large as 1%
##   affecting all time measurements in the run time system. 
##
## Per the above change to a different mode if really needed.

# +B [c | d | i]
# Option c makes Ctrl-C interrupt the current shell instead of invoking the emulator break
# handler. Option d (same as specifying +B without an extra option) disables the break handler. # Option i makes the emulator ignore any break signal.
# If option c is used with oldshell on Unix, Ctrl-C will restart the shell process rather than
# interrupt it.
# Disable the emulator break handler
# it easy to accidentally type ctrl-c when trying
# to reach for ctrl-d. ctrl-c on a live node can
# have very undesirable results
